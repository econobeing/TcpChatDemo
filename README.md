# TcpChatDemo
A small demo for multithreaded TCP programming

This is a proof of concept of how to handle multithreaded network programming in a client/server scenario using C#, the System.Net.Sockets namespace, and the System.Threading namespace. 

It is meant to be extremely basic with few features and simple/no error handling.
